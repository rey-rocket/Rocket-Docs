# Cedar-Style Documentation Transformation Plan

## Executive Summary

Transform the Rocket Learning Rewards documentation to match Cedar Copilot's clean, modern design while maintaining Rocket's content and brand identity. The plan focuses on navigation restructuring, visual design updates, and improved user experience.

## Key Design Elements from Cedar

### 1. Navigation Structure
- **Clean sidebar hierarchy** with logical groupings
- **Card-based homepage** with "Quick Navigation" and "Core Features" sections
- **Minimal, focused categories** rather than deep nesting
- **Developer-friendly presentation** with clear technical sections

### 2. Visual Design
- **Modern card layout** with hover effects
- **Teal/green color scheme** (to be adapted to Rocket orange/purple)
- **Clean typography** with excellent readability
- **Dark/light mode** with seamless transitions
- **Responsive grid system** for cards and content

### 3. Content Organization
- **Hero section** with compelling tagline
- **Feature highlights** in card format
- **Technical sections** clearly separated from user guides
- **Quick access points** for common tasks

## Transformation Plan

### Phase 1: Navigation Restructuring

**Current Rocket Navigation Issues:**
- Too many top-level sections (6 main sections)
- Deep nesting creates confusion
- Mixed audience targeting in single sections
- Unclear information hierarchy

**Proposed Cedar-Style Navigation:**

### Phase 2: Homepage Redesign

**New Homepage Structure (Cedar-Inspired):**

1. **Hero Section**
   - Tagline: "Fuel Engagement. Reward Progress. Drive Success."
   - Subtitle: "Transform learning experiences with research-based gamification and real-world rewards from 3,000+ brands"
   - Primary CTA: "Get Started"
   - Secondary CTA: "View Documentation"

2. **Quick Navigation Cards (4 cards)**
   - Getting Started
   - LMS Integrations  
   - User Management
   - Analytics & Reporting

3. **Core Features Cards (6 cards)**
   - Gamification Engine
   - Real-World Rewards
   - Multi-Tenant Architecture
   - Analytics Dashboard
   - API Integration
   - Support System

### Phase 3: Visual Design Updates

**Color Scheme Adaptation:**
- Primary: Rocket Orange (#ff6b6b → Cedar Teal equivalent)
- Secondary: Rocket Purple (#667eea → Cedar Green equivalent)
- Accent: Maintain Rocket's orange for CTAs
- Background: Clean whites/grays with subtle gradients

**Card Design:**
```css
.feature-card {
  background: linear-gradient(145deg, #ffffff, #f8f9fa);
  border-radius: 12px;
  padding: 24px;
  border-left: 4px solid var(--rocket-orange);
  box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);
  transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease;
}

.feature-card:hover {
  transform: translateY(-4px);
  box-shadow: 0 8px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
}
```

**Typography:**
- Headings: Keep Inter font but increase weight
- Body: Maintain readability with proper line spacing
- Code: JetBrains Mono for technical sections

### Phase 4: Content Strategy

**Homepage Content Blocks:**

1. **Hero Message**
   ```
   "Transform learning experiences with research-based gamification"
   "For the first time in education, engagement can be measured and rewarded at scale."
   ```

2. **Quick Navigation Cards:**
   - **Getting Started**: "Set up your first rewards system in under 30 minutes"
   - **LMS Integration**: "Connect with Moodle, Canvas, and 15+ other platforms"
   - **User Management**: "Onboard thousands of students with CSV imports"
   - **Analytics**: "Track engagement and optimize learning outcomes"

3. **Core Features Cards:**
   - **Gamification Engine**: "Streaks, ranks, and progression systems"
   - **Real Rewards**: "3,000+ brands across 35+ countries"
   - **Multi-Tenancy**: "Enterprise-ready with isolated data"
   - **Analytics**: "Mixpanel integration and custom reporting"
   - **API Access**: "RESTful APIs for custom integrations"
   - **24/7 Support**: "Dedicated success team and documentation"
