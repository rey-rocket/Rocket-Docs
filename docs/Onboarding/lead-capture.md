# Lead Capture & Qualification

Rocket Learning Rewards identifies partners across two key segments: Client Partners and Institutional Partners.

## Client Partners (Rewards Providers)

These partners include local businesses, online stores, and campus-affiliated vendors. We assess:

- Their interest in participating in student reward programmes
- Their ability to deliver incentives such as vouchers, experiences, or discounts
- The fit of their brand or offering with our student user base

Once qualified, partners are guided through reward catalogue setup, branding, and redemption processes.

## Institutional Partners (LMS Hosts)

These include colleges, universities, and corporate academies. We assess:

- The readiness of the LMS platform for integration
- The institutional interest in tracking and improving learner engagement
- The ability to assign internal owners for training and administration

## Next-Step Triggers

To progress to onboarding:

- Schedule a discovery or demo call with stakeholders
- Share our product overview deck and institutional case studies
- Provide access to self-serve materials for evaluation and sign-up (if enabled)
