# LMS Integration Planning

To ensure seamless deployment, LMS integration planning involves both technical scoping and documentation handover.

## Initial Technical Consultation

This meeting with the LMS System Administrator will determine:

- Supported integration formats (Webhooks, REST API, LTI)
- Total number of learners, educators, and active courses
- Whether the institution uses staging/test environments
- Required technical access: sandbox accounts or dummy users

## Supporting Materials Provided

Institutions will receive:

- A comprehensive system overview
- API keys, endpoint documentation, and LMS-specific playbooks
- Data privacy and security policies
- Detailed use cases for Canvas, Moodle, and LearnWorlds
